# Disable the outfile_loaddata test, which as of 5.1.38 is giving
# platform-dependent results, with the "expected" results being arguably the
# wrong ones.  This is upstream at http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=46895
# (note that upstream has also disabled it, but only for Solaris, so we still
# need to disable it here).
# Still broken in 5.5.14, despite alleged fix.

outfile_loaddata          : bug#46895 code wrong, expected results wrong too

# Disable innodb.innodb, which is showing platform-dependent results
# as of 5.5.9.  Upstream at http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=60155

innodb.innodb             : bug#60155 has platform-dependent results
